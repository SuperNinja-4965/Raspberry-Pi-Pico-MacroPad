# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-MacroPad
This code allows you to use the Pimoroni RGB Keypad for the Pico as a macro keypad in C++

To edit the keybinds for the Pimoroni RGB Keypad go to the Settings.cpp file.
The Project does not have support for an IR sensor at this time but I will add support for it later.

The Code cannot be published pre-compiled because all of the keybinds are set in the code.
